- No console errors in production
- Bundle size: 1.32MB (could be optimized with code splitting)

## Tests
- tests.json contains 220 comprehensive tests
- 5 tests explicitly marked as passing with screenshots
- Many more tests verified working via E2E Playwright tests

## Screenshots Captured
Located in screenshots/issue-14/:
- flow-01 through flow-17: Complete user flow from project creation through all pages
- test-001 through test-005: Specific test verification screenshots

## Known Limitations
- Bundle size is large (1.32MB) - could benefit from code splitting
- IndexedDB data persists only in browser (by design)
- No backend/authentication (as per requirements)

## Session Summary
This session:
1. Fixed CSS @import order warning
2. Verified all major pages work correctly via E2E Playwright tests
3. Captured comprehensive screenshots of the entire application flow
