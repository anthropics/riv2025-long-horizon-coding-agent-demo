## Previous Session Summary (Issue #26 - Empty Board Create Issue Bug Fix)
Fixed a bug where clicking the "Create Issue" button on an empty board page did nothing.

### Bug Description:
When a user:
1. Navigated to a project's board page
2. The board was empty (no issues)
3. Clicked the "Create Issue" button
Nothing would happen - the Create Issue modal would not open.

### Root Cause:
The `BoardPage.tsx` component had an early return for the empty board state that did not include the `CreateIssueModal` component. The modal was only rendered in the main return statement, but the empty state return happened before that code was reached.

### Fix Applied:
Wrapped the empty state return in a React Fragment (`<>...</>`) and included the `CreateIssueModal` component within it, so the modal is rendered even when the board is empty.

```jsx
// Empty state - now includes CreateIssueModal
if (issues.length === 0 && !quickFilter) {
  return (
    <>
      <div className="flex flex-col items-center justify-center h-[60vh]">
        {/* Empty board UI */}
      </div>

      {/* Create Issue Modal - must be rendered in empty state too */}
      <CreateIssueModal
        open={createModalOpen}
        onOpenChange={(open) => {
          setCreateModalOpen(open);
          if (!open) setCreateInColumn(undefined);
        }}
        defaultStatus={createInColumn}
      />
    </>
  );
}
```

### Files Modified:
- src/pages/BoardPage.tsx - Added CreateIssueModal to empty state return

### New Test Added (test-235):
- test-235: Create Issue button on empty board page opens the create issue modal

### E2E Tests:
- e2e-tests/issue-26-empty-board-create.spec.ts - 2 Playwright tests for empty board create issue
- e2e-tests/test-235-verify.spec.ts - Specific test to verify the fix
- e2e-tests/test-235-capture.spec.ts - Screenshot capture test
