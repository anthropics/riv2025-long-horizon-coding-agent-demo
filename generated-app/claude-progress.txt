### Commit: 349727a - fix: Language settings now translate all pages (#39)

## Issue #39 - Language Settings Translate All Pages (COMPLETE)
Fixed the bug where language settings were only translating the Profile Settings page but not all other pages in the application.

### Bug Description:
When users changed the language setting (e.g., to Japanese), only the Settings page was translated. All other pages remained in English.

### Root Cause:
Several pages were not using the translations object from the AppContext. They had hardcoded English strings instead of using the `translations: t` pattern from `useApp()`.

### Pages Fixed:
1. **VelocityPage.tsx** - Added translations for velocity chart, stats, recommendations, sprint planning suggestions
2. **SprintReportPage.tsx** - Added translations for sprint reports, stats, charts, team performance
3. **NewProjectPage.tsx** - Added translations for create project form, validation messages, buttons
4. **ProjectSettingsPage.tsx** - Added translations for general settings, workflow, export, danger zone
5. **ProjectsPage.tsx** - Added translations for projects list, search, archive/restore actions
6. **CalendarPage.tsx** - Already using translations (verified)
7. **RoadmapPage.tsx** - Already using translations (verified)
8. **HomePage.tsx** - Already using translations (verified)
9. **SprintsPage.tsx** - Already using translations (verified)
10. **BurndownPage.tsx** - Already using translations (verified)
11. **ComponentsPage.tsx** - Already using translations (verified)
12. **LabelsPage.tsx** - Already using translations (verified)

### Translation Keys Added (80+ new keys):
**Velocity Page:**
- trackTeamVelocity, ptsPerSprint, commitmentReliability, sprintsCompleted, velocityTrend
- committed, recommendations, sprintPlanningSuggestion, recommendedCommitment, completionRate
- completeSprintsToSeeVelocity, reduceCommitmentWarning, velocityTrendingDown, velocityImproving
- moreSprintsNeeded, teamVelocityStable, accountsForVariation

**Sprint Report Page:**
- detailedBreakdown, totalIssues, teamPerformance, statusDistribution, issueTypeDistribution
- sprintIssues, sprintDetails, duration, notSet, noGoalSet, selectSprintToViewReport, pts

**New Project Page:**
- createNewProject, back, projectNameRequired, projectKeyRequired, projectKeyInUse
- keyPrefix, describeYourProject, projectColor, projectCreatedSuccess, failedToCreateProject

**Project Settings Page:**
- manageSettingsFor, general, basicProjectInfo, projectKeyCannotChange, settingsSaved
- failedToSaveSettings, workflowSection, assignWorkflow, workflowDeterminesStatuses
- statusFlow, saveWorkflow, manageWorkflows, exportSection, exportProjectData
- downloadProjectJson, projectExported, failedToExport, restoreProject, archiveProject
- restoreProjectDesc, archiveProjectDesc, projectRestored, projectArchived
- failedToUpdateProject, deleteProjectTitle, deleteProjectWarning, typeToConfirm
- projectDeleted, failedToDeleteProject

**Projects Page:**
- manageViewProjects, searchProjectsPlaceholder, showActive, showArchived
- noProjectsMatchSearch, noArchivedProjects, noProjectsYet

### All 5 Languages Updated:
- English (en)
- Japanese (ja)
- Chinese/Mandarin (zh)
- Arabic (ar)
- Spanish (es)

### E2E Tests Added:
- e2e-tests/translation-test.spec.ts - Tests language switching and translation across pages (1/1 passing)

### Build Status:
- `npm run build` succeeds without errors ✅
- All new tests pass ✅

## Issue #42 - User Space with Authentication (COMPLETE)

## Issue #42 - User Space with Authentication (COMPLETE)
Added user authentication system allowing users to create accounts, sign in/out, and have their work persisted across sessions.

### Feature Description:
Users can now:
1. Create an account with email, password, and name
2. Sign in with existing credentials
3. Sign out from the user menu
4. Have their settings, preferences, and work persisted to their account
5. Access protected routes only when authenticated (after first user exists)

### Implementation Details:
The authentication system uses IndexedDB (via Dexie.js) to store:
- **AuthUser**: User credentials (email, password hash, name, settings)
- **AuthSession**: Session tokens with expiration (30 days)

Authentication flow:
- First-time users see the main app directly (no auth required until first account is created)
- Once an account exists, users must sign in to access the app
- Sessions are validated on page load
- Sign out clears the session and redirects to login

### New Files Created:

- src/App.tsx - Added AuthProvider wrapper, ProtectedRoute and AuthRoute components, /login route
- src/components/layout/Header.tsx - Added auth integration with sign out functionality in user menu
- src/lib/translations.ts - Added 30 new auth-related translations in all 5 languages (EN, JA, ZH, AR, ES)

### Login/Signup Page Features:
- Canopy branding with leaf logo
- "Welcome Back" (login) / "Create Account" (signup) headings

## Issue #41 - Story of Completion (COMPLETE)
Added an engaging sardonic story modal that appears at the end of each task completion to celebrate the accomplishment.

- A sardonic, engaging completion story (200 words or less)
- A progress bar that auto-closes after 6 seconds
- A "Continue Conquering" button to manually dismiss

### Implementation Details:
The completion story modal triggers alongside confetti in two scenarios:
1. **Dragging to Done column** - When a user drags an issue card to the "Done" column on the Kanban board

## Issue #40 - Confetti Animation (COMPLETE)
Added confetti animation that plays whenever a task is marked as complete.

### Feature Description:
When a task is marked as complete (moved to "Done" status), a beautiful confetti animation appears on screen to celebrate the accomplishment. The confetti uses the app's color palette (ruby red, coral, yellow, rose) for a cohesive visual experience.

### Implementation Details:
The confetti animation triggers in three scenarios:
1. **Dragging to Done column** - When a user drags an issue card to the "Done" column on the Kanban board
2. **Status dropdown change** - When a user changes the status to "Done" via the dropdown in the issue detail panel

- Animation: 3 sequential bursts from center, left, and right
- Particle count: 50 (main burst) + 30 (left) + 30 (right) = 110 particles total

## Previous Session Summary (Issue #26 - Empty Board Create Issue Bug Fix)
Fixed a bug where clicking the "Create Issue" button on an empty board page did nothing.

### Bug Description:
When a user:
1. Navigated to a project's board page
2. The board was empty (no issues)
3. Clicked the "Create Issue" button
Nothing would happen - the Create Issue modal would not open.

### Root Cause:
The `BoardPage.tsx` component had an early return for the empty board state that did not include the `CreateIssueModal` component. The modal was only rendered in the main return statement, but the empty state return happened before that code was reached.

### Fix Applied:
Wrapped the empty state return in a React Fragment (`<>...</>`) and included the `CreateIssueModal` component within it, so the modal is rendered even when the board is empty.

```jsx
// Empty state - now includes CreateIssueModal
if (issues.length === 0 && !quickFilter) {
  return (
    <>
      <div className="flex flex-col items-center justify-center h-[60vh]">
        {/* Empty board UI */}
      </div>

      {/* Create Issue Modal - must be rendered in empty state too */}
      <CreateIssueModal
        open={createModalOpen}
        onOpenChange={(open) => {
          setCreateModalOpen(open);
          if (!open) setCreateInColumn(undefined);
        }}
        defaultStatus={createInColumn}
      />
    </>
  );
}
```

### Files Modified:
- src/pages/BoardPage.tsx - Added CreateIssueModal to empty state return

### New Test Added (test-235):
- test-235: Create Issue button on empty board page opens the create issue modal

### E2E Tests:
- e2e-tests/issue-26-empty-board-create.spec.ts - 2 Playwright tests for empty board create issue
- e2e-tests/test-235-verify.spec.ts - Specific test to verify the fix
- e2e-tests/test-235-capture.spec.ts - Screenshot capture test
