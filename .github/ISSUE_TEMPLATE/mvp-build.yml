        ## Long-Horizon Agent Build

        This kicks off the autonomous agent to build the application.

        ### How it works
        1. Create this issue (just click "Create" below)
        2. Add a rocket reaction to approve it
        3. The agent automatically starts building using `prompts/{project}/BUILD_PLAN.md`
        4. Progress updates and screenshots will be posted to this issue
        5. Code is committed to the `agent-runtime` branch

        ### Architecture details
        - **Specification:** The agent reads from `prompts/{project}/BUILD_PLAN.md`
        - **Issue queue:** Approved issues are synced to `human_backlog.json` on EFS
        - **Polling:** The agent pulls from `human_backlog.json` to find the next issue to work on
        - **Branch:** All work is committed to the `agent-runtime` branch
        - **Single runtime:** Only ONE agent runs at a time - additional issues are queued automatically

        **You don't need to provide any additional details** - the full specification is already in the repo.
